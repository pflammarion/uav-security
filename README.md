# Abstract

As Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) become an increasingly important part of our daily lives. From package delivery to military missions, it's important to consider the threats that can affect UAVs. 
It is imperative to effectively mitigate security concerns such as unauthorized access, malicious control, unlawful association, and other attacks while ensuring that these measures do not adversely impact system performance. 
Moreover, wireless communication protocols play a crucial role in UAV operations. Therefore, this paper focuses on threats to communications between the Ground Control Station (GCS) and the UAVs.
We outline the main characteristics of existing protocols, such as Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink), UranusLink, and UAVCan, and their vulnerabilities. 
This paper shows the risks of data injections through a GPS spoofing simulation and a Denial of Service (DoS).
This work shows the methodology used to simulate attacks using the Software in the Loop method on UAVs using the MAVLink protocol.
This simulation highlights the flaws in the MAVLink protocol and their potential risks.
Such exploits have serious impacts on UAV security.
To conclude this paper, we proposed two methodologies to prevent this type of attack: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and multi-factor authentication for UAV control.
